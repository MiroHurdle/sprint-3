When I shrunk the responsive boilerplate page down below 550 px, it looked pretty good. A lot of the the items that were laid out horizontally switched so you could look at them vertically. Everything looked fine except the column examples. Each one took up the full width regardless of the number associated with them. I think this would actually be a fairly positve thing because wwhen the screen is that small, anyhthing under the "1 column" tag would be way too tiny to see. I think that the way this works is through media queries, so that when tusing a small deveice like a mobile phone the site still looks good.
