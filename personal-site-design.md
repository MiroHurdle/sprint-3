What is my site's primary use?
Currently my site gives the user a little bit of information about me and access to a number of blogs I have written about my experience with EDA up to this point. Later it will most likely have  a couple of projects that I have done and the user can check out and interact with.

Who is my target audience?
My audience at the the time is exclusively other EDA members who are interested in seeing what others have done. When I am a little bit more comfortable with web design and get the website to look a bit more like I want it to I may tell my friends and family so they can see what I have been working on and what I've learned.

How do I want site visitors to interact with my site?
I would like it if they read the little blurb about me and then checked out a blog or two. I am not necessarily trying to get someone to read through every blog unless they are genuinely interested in doing so. Right now I am perfectly happy to have some one skim some of my writing to get a feel for who I am and how I express my thoughts.
What experience do you want them to have?
I just want anyone who is using my site to get a small sense of who I am. I think its incredibly difficult to get to know someone through their writing, but I think that reading someone's work allows you to learn at least a little bit about the writer.

How will I build my site to support my desired user experience?
I think if I am honest, clear, and succinct in my writing, and have an aesthetically pleasing website with an easily accessible layout, users will be interested in what I have to offer. Obviously this is easier said than done and I will need to work hard on the code to achieve this result.
